I recently learned how to make Thai sticky rice thats just so damn good and divine?
Btw: just in case someone is actually reading this. This is for udacity school. I'm new. Dont be judgy or mean

Step one: pick up some Thai sticky rice (or sweet rice or glutinous rice) from your local oriental store.
Step two: pour the rice in a bowl and rinse the extra starch off from the rice several times until the water appears clear.
Step three: let the sticky rice soak for at least 4 hours to over night
Step four: transfer the rice from the bowl to a heat resistant strainer (Traditionally a bamboo strainer is used) and steam the rice for 20 mins.
            (Side note yesterday i was desperate for rice but didn't have any that was presoaked so i used a pressure cooker, and an aluminum foil doughnut to
			prop the metallic strainer, and let it steam for 30 mins and it wasn't bad at all)

Taa daa :D
